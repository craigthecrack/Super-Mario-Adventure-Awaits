(corny alert)
It's been a blast to be part of this community and i'm happy that it happened. Why am I making such a big deal about smth so unimaginably simple? Idk, it's just what i wanna do lmao. I'm gonna address this a bit more in detail than I did in NHD tho. I left, because I simply have no motivation nor interest to work on my or any project anymore. I constantly have this feeling of "be productive, do smth for the mod" and I really hated it. I couldn't really spend my freetime or any time at all without thinking of "being productive". I kept telling myself that my mod will never get cancelled, I'll just take breaks as long as I want and work on it whenever I want, but after I submitted my trailer for the direct, i did not work on anything ever since and I didn't want to work on anything either. Another reason as to why I left is the community and its members. The few people that I can call friends aren't the problem (duh) and i am so so so so glad that i met them, cause they are awesome and care about me. The rest of the community (excluding people i don't know, never interacted with or that helped and supported me with my projects) are just assholes. Racism and homophobia being pretty common, which is already a bad sign. But here are the highlights: being told to just be myself but then have people tell me that i'm annoying and should shut the fuck up n allat (like my fault original gangster). having literal adults gang up on me because i sent a reaction gif and then insult me????? and my personal favorite: being lied to by almost everyone that they apparently enjoy my presence and definetly want me around only to have hus of all people tell me that all of you hate me in private but not have the fucking balls to tell me (OR ANYONE YOU GUYS DON'T LIKE, JUST FUCKING TELL THEM ITS NOT THAT FUCKING HARD OMG). This community forces itself to act welcoming and nice, but all of that is just bullshit. I've seen people leave evolution for example cause they've been told that their mod idea is stupid or smth like get your head out of your ass, is it that hard to be nice to someone??? ANYWAYS, waah waah crack is just crying, ik none of you care lmao. I don't have plans to come back to you guys and it will stay like that, but lets not exclude some things here. I just wanna say, should I ever (0.00000001% chance of happening) come back, i don't want any bullshit from you. Welcome me with open arms and boom, thats all lmao. Also, yes i did tell baron to kill himself and i stand by it, but it seems like it only affected those who i disliked the most anyway, cause the people that didnt care are actually nice people!! Ok ok, whatever, crack yap session is over and I wish you guys the best and I love y'all!!!!! :>

BTW DONT BRING THIS UP IN A PUBLIC SERVER, IF MIGUEL SENDS ME A DM ABOUT ME STIRRING UP DRAMA AGAIN THEN I AM GOING TO LOSE MY FUCKING MIND ISTG ðŸ˜­
thats all
